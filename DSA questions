Q) Bfs and Dfs difference?

breadth-first Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are algorithms used to traverse graphs or trees. BFS visits all the nodes of a graph or tree level by level starting from the root node. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit. DFS visits nodes by exploring one path from the root node until it reaches a leaf node, and then backtracks to find the next path. It uses a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit.

breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are two algorithms used in graph traversal. BFS visits all the nodes of a graph in a layer-wise manner, starting from the root node, while DFS starts from the root node and explores each branch completely before moving onto the next branch. 

In BFS, the edges are explored in a breadth-first manner, i.e., the nodes of the same level (distance from the root) are visited before any node of the next level. DFS, on the other hand, visits nodes in a depth-first manner, i.e., the nodes of a single branch are explored before any other branch. 

BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph, while DFS is suitable for traversing a graph in a recursive manner. BFS is less demanding in terms of memory, while DFS may require more memory as it involves storing all the nodes in memory before visiting them. On the other hand, DFS may find a path faster than BFS in some cases.

what is binary search tree?
ans> A
 Binary Search Tree (BST) is a self-balancing binary tree data structure used to store and retrieve data in a searchable, sorted order. In a BST, each node contains a key and left and right pointers that reference other nodes or null. The left key is always less than the root key, and the right key is always greater than the root key. BSTs are efficient for searching, inserting, and deleting data elements, making them a popular choice for many applications. In addition to the basic operations, BSTs can also be used to find the in-order predecessor, successor, and the maximum and minimum elements in the tree. BSTs are implemented in the C programming language using the same basic structure that applies to any other language. To add an element to the tree, a new node is created with the appropriate data and the left and right pointers are set to point to null. The new node's key is then compared with the root node's key and if it is larger, it is added to the right subtree. If the new node's key is smaller than the root node's key, it is added to the left subtree. The process is repeated until the new node is either added to the tree or no more elements can be added.

 What is balance factor in c?
 ans>>Balance factor in C is a measure of how unbalanced the tree structure is. The tree structure needs to
 maintain a balance of its own to ensure that all operations (such as searching, inserting, deleting, etc.) can be performed in the best possible time. The balance factor of a node in C is calculated by subtracting the height of the right sub-tree from the height of the left sub-tree. For any node, the value of its balance factor can be a number from -2 to +2. If the balance factor is -2 or +2, the tree structure is considered to be unbalanced and needs to be rebalanced. A balance factor of 0 means that the tree is perfectly balanced. The various tree operations (such as insertion, deletion, and searching) are performed in an effort to maintain balance and ensure that the tree structure operates optimally.

 Write an algorithm to find number of leaf node and check whether the tree is balnced or not?
 
 Algorithm to check if a
 binary tree is balanced and to count the number of leaf nodes: 
1. If the binary tree is empty, return 0 leaf nodes and true for a balanced tree
2. If the tree is not empty, check the height of the left subtree and right subtree. 
3. If the difference between the heights of the left and right subtree is not greater than 1, the tree is balanced.
4. Calculate the number of leaf nodes in the tree by recursively counting the number of leaf nodes in the left subtree and right subtree and adding them together. 
5. Return the number of leaf nodes and true if the tree is balanced, and false if it is not.

Write recursive and iterative version of insertion sort and also mention its time complexity?

Ans_ Insertion sort is an algorithm
 that sorts a given array or list by gradually shifting elements to the right until they are in the correct order.

Recursive Insertion Sort
Recursive insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts a given array or list by taking the last element of the array, inserting it into its correct position in the sorted array, and then repeating the same procedure with the rest of the element in the array until all elements are sorted. The recursive insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) which means that the algorithm takes n^2 time to complete the sorting process.

Iterative Insertion Sort
Iterative insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that works by comparing each element of the array with the elements that come before it in the array and then inserting it in the correct position. The iterative insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) which means that the algorithm takes n^2 time to complete the sorting process.

Overall, insertion sort is an algorithm that works by gradually sorting an array or list by shifting elements to the right until they are in the correct order. The recursive and iterative versions of insertion sort both have a time complexity of O(n^2). It is important to note that insertion sort is not a very efficient algorithm for large amounts of data as the time complexity increases exponentially with the size of the data.

Write an algorithm or quick sort and also mention time complexity in each case and space complexity?

1. Divide the
 unsorted list into two sublists, one containing the elements smaller than the pivot element, and the other containing elements larger than the pivot.

2. For each sublist, use the quick sort algorithm recursively to further divide the elements until all of the sublists are sorted.

3. Concatenate the sublists back into one sorted list.

Time Complexity: 
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2)

Space Complexity: O(1)
